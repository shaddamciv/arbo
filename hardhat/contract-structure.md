Point 1 - Regular Growth Potential - 
Based on when a seed was created upto the time a user waters it a meter called the growth potential meter keeps increasing or remaining still based on ETH/MATIC price
Once a user pays a mini fee to water plant, he joins the race for earning a portion of the winnings

API's required for gamemaker - > Pass seed Id -> Returns growth potential in Meters, last watered date, threshold level in meters.  (Gamemaker will first fetch a list of all the current seeds)  

Point 2 - Threshold Exponential Race - 
From then only like paying X times the last payment amount can grow the tree faster, at this point one user can only make a payment once for that one plant.  If noone outbids the last player for a period of 48 hours since last  payment the last player wins all. If even one bidder piles on top of the first bidder post threshold. All the accounts that participated before threshold gets 10% prorated. The winner gets all the pot.

In this phase, the amount each successive player plays depends on the size of the tree that the prev player managed to raise it by.

Point 3 - Sow for the future - 
People can use the UMA protocol to make outcome predictions. If these outcomes turn true. They get special credits, which they can use to grow spurt by 2X, 5X etc
This is like people can redeem tickets for winning first. Then they can use that ticket to enter while the tree is growing in any phase to grow the tree faster
